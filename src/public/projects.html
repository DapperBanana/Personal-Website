            Trust me, I know... It's a weird assortment of projects. I've tried to keep the list short though there are tiny little projects
            I take on all of the time. You'll notice the list is all over the place, but so am I so it's fitting that you'll find web design 
            side by SDR projects and low level programming.

            Now as any good programmer will tell you... We have ego's and need them constantly validated. As such please enjoy my proof that I 
            contribute to GitHub (very important).

        <p>
            And if me contributing constantly to GitHub isn't enough for you, here's a CodersRank summary of me as a developer. As they are the
            definitive spot on the internet (who doesn't wake up and immediately check their ranking?) you can clearly see that I am amazing.
            Ignore the fact that I'm not the best at anything and that top percentile becomes a lot more impressive.

                    <h4>Description:</h4>
                    <p>
                    After seeing some other personal website projects I wanted to modernize my own. I had a couple of goals in mind when I started
                        this project. I wanted to make sure that I could easily maintain the site, that I could easily add blog posts in, that I could
                        include some sort of interactivity, and most importantly that I could host it on my own server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Locally hosting is always tricky, but I like the challenge some times. As I already owned the domain, I figured I could just
                        create a powershell script to automate the A record changes and then use certbot to get a free SSL certificate. After that I
                        just needed to create a docker container that would host the site and I could easily update it with a github action whenever
                        I wanted to make some changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    While this is definitley not a perfect website, and I'll be making continuous changes as time goes on, I'm happy with the result
                        and I think it's a good representation of my skills and interests. I hope you enjoy it as well!

                    <p>
                    Recently in 2023 I bought my first house. I was excited to finally have a place to call my own and I wanted to make sure that
                        I could automate as much as possible. I started with the basics, I wanted to be able to turn on and off my lights, I wanted
                        to be able to control my thermostat, and I wanted to be able to have hubs around the house (as well as an app of some sort)
                        that would allow me to control everything. Preferably everything in the house would be locally hosted though that's quite 
                        hard to do these days so I thought we'd just try to limit the amount of externally connected devices (within reason). Above
                        all though, everything needed to be done safely, securely, and had to meet the "wife test".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In order to even start most of this a lot of the electrical needed to be redone. So after tearing down drywall, rewiring the house
                        and installing new switches, I was finally ready to start the automation process. Using Home Assistant as a base I was able to
                        get most of the automation done fairly quickly. I was able to control my lights, my thermostat, and my hubs all from one place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using some strategically placed old iPads, Ubiquiti AP's (and cameras), and some custom built hubs I was able to get the house
                        up and running in no time. I even had a couple of friends over to test it out and they were impressed. I'm still working on
                        some of the more advanced features, but I'm happy with the result so far. I've even made it externally available so we can check
                        in on the house while away.

                    <h4>Description:</h4>
                    <p>
                        While sitting at home during the pandemic I was struggling to find a good project to sit down and do. After a bit
                        of hum and haw I finally landed on making a game... In Discord. This was also BEFORE they announced they were going 
                        to make full fledged games inside of Discord so it seemed somewhat original since I couldn't find a single example 
                        of what I was doing. After some deliberating I decided I wanted full audio support for a complete roguelike experience
                        inside of a channel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The backend of this is largely the same as a normal project, you create your random dungeon, you spawn the creatures 
                        and the treasure, you set your goal, and you're off to the races. I added a couple more things like a boss on level 10,
                        attribute leveling, weapons, and a 5e based RNG combat system. It came together fairly nicely, the only tricky thing
                        was dealing with Discord. I needed to have it so that other people couldn't screw you over in chat, if multiple people
                        wanted to play I needed profiles with saves, and I also needed a timeout in case someone left discord for the day and 
                        someone else decided they wanted to grind a bit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All in all I think it took me a couple months to get the first version done which worked pretty well. Ever since then I
                        jump into the code base to clean it up, add some new features, fix some bugs, and try to make it run a bit better. It's 
                        not perfect, and I definitely break it more than anything else, but it was a fun project and a good way to learn some 
                        python that I otherwise wouldn't have known.

                    <h4>Description:</h4>
                    <p>
                        A little bit ago I started working on an NES emulator. I've always been interested in low level programming and I thought
                        this would be a good way to keep flexing some of those muscles. I started with the basics, I decided I'd build a 
                        frame-accurate emulator and emulate the system hardware instead of translating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While this is a currently ongoing project I've made some good progress. I've been able to get the CPU working, start on the BUS,
                        and locally even get some of the PPU logic working.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project will take me quite a while but I'm happy for all of the documentation that's floating around there as I don't know
                        I'd have the patience to soft through some of the original architecture in my spare time these days. All of that being said though
                        I'm excited to make some more progress and see where this project goes.

                    <p>
                        I've always been interested in radio and radio astronomy. I've been playing around with SDR's for a while now and I thought
                        it would be fun to try and decode some P25 signals. I started with the basics, I wanted to be able to decode some local police
                        chatter and see if I could get some of the data to display on a screen.

                        It's been fun to return to some of my roots and play around in the trunked radio space like I used to. I'm excited to make some
                        more progress and see where this project goes.

                        Since I got into the SDR space I have always wanted to gather some radio astronomy data. I've been playing around with
                        some of the local radio astronomy clubs and I thought it would be fun to try and get some GOES imagery. I started with the
                        basics, I wanted to be able to get some of the local weather data and see if I could get some of the imagery to display on
                        a screen.

            Trust me, I know... It's a weird assortment of projects. I've tried to keep the list short though there are tiny little projects
            I take on all of the time. You'll notice the list is all over the place, but so am I so it's fitting that you'll find web design 
            side by SDR projects and low level programming.
        </p>

            Hopefully there's something that peaks your interest and never forget to reach out if you want to chat about anything!

            Now as any good programmer will tell you... We have ego's and need them constantly validated. As such please enjoy my proof that I 
            contribute to GitHub (very important).

        <p>
            And if me contributing constantly to GitHub isn't enough for you, here's a CodersRank summary of me as a developer. As they are the
            definitive spot on the internet (who doesn't wake up and immediately check their ranking?) you can clearly see that I am amazing.
            Ignore the fact that I'm not the best at anything and that top percentile becomes a lot more impressive.

                            So you have an interest in radio... You've come to the right place. The wild world of analog first caught my
                            interest when I was but a wee lad. Ever since then I've hoped and dreamed for a job where I can use some of 
                            the creativity and flexibility seen in analog tech. Alas, I had one job that dealt with radio communications
                            and the rest have been slowly pushing me into software/data engineering so this has become a hobby for me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After finding out about SDR a number of years ago I've slowly been growing my antennas (both homemade and 
                            pre-built). this has allowed me to work on a number of projects, whether it be the starters like finding 
                            radio stations, intercepting air traffic controller communication, following active flights in my area, intercepting 
                            local emergency service communications, and then even to more recent projects like trying to read unencrypted
                            P25 communications, radio-photography through GOES satellites, and even trying my hand at creating a weather 
                            database pipeline using NOAA satellites.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There's always something to do with SDR and please reach out if you want to nerd out over frequencies, I truly
                            do find this one of the most interesting subjects.

                        <p>
                            While sitting at home during the pandemic I was struggling to find a good project to sit down and do. After a bit
                            of hum and haw I finally landed on making a game... In Discord. This was also BEFORE they announced they were going 
                            to make full fledged games inside of Discord so it seemed somewhat original since I couldn't find a single example 
                            of what I was doing. After some deliberating I decided I wanted full audio support for a complete roguelike experience
                            inside of a channel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The backend of this is largely the same as a normal project, you create your random dungeon, you spawn the creatures 
                            and the treasure, you set your goal, and you're off to the races. I added a couple more things like a boss on level 10,
                            attribute leveling, weapons, and a 5e based RNG combat system. It came together fairly nicely, the only tricky thing
                            was dealing with Discord. I needed to have it so that other people couldn't screw you over in chat, if multiple people
                            wanted to play I needed profiles with saves, and I also needed a timeout in case someone left discord for the day and 
                            someone else decided they wanted to grind a bit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All in all I think it took me a couple months to get the first version done which worked pretty well. Ever since then I
                            jump into the code base to clean it up, add some new features, fix some bugs, and try to make it run a bit better. It's 
                            not perfect, and I definitely break it more than anything else, but it was a fun project and a good way to learn some 
                            python that I otherwise wouldn't have known.

                            I don't have much to say about this one other than so far it's been awesome to go back to my roots and deal with some 
                            low level learning. Dealing with 6502 architecture is a ton of fun and I'm looking forward to implementing some
                            emulator features once I can get some of the more complex parts of the NES done.

                        <p>
                            Ahhh lox. I remember reading Robert Nystroms "Game Design Patterns" book when I was in college and falling in love 
                            with his style (don't look at me like that, it's not weird...). When I started reading his "Crafting Interpreters"
                            bible I couldn't put it down. Something that I never knew I was interested in all of a sudden just clicked and I 
                            knew I had to try to make this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Crafting an interpreter that someone else is showing you STEP BY STEP how to create... Is still hard. It took me 
                            far too long to understand some of the concepts he was talking about. This is also WITH experience doing exactly
                            what he's trying to teach me. Some CS concepts are just hard to grasp (might also just be me). Regardless with some 
                            serious work and probably too many hours, I finished my Java implementation and immediately got started on his final 
                            implementation: C.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think I had a lot more fun in C than I did with Java, in part to me enjoying the language more. While no one really 
                            fully understands C it feels more at home to an embedded programmer like myself. Anyways, I could chat about my 
                            struggles, triumphs, and joys with this book (and I still might one day) but for now I'll just say: "Go read it!"

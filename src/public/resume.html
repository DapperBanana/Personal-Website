              <h4>Description:</h4>
              <p>
                As a Business Analyst at Heartland Generation, my pillar was operational applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my day to day I would actively contribute to project management efforts, overseeing new and innovative ideas 
                from an information systems perspective. I would collaborate with cross-functional teams, identify opportunities for 
                process improvement, and drive positive change throughout the organization, resulting in enhanced productivity and 
                optimized business outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As operational applications are the backbone of our organization, I played a key role in ensuring the reliability and
                performance of our applications, including CI/CD automation, server administration, and application administration. This
                spanned applications such as our MOC & Incident management, fleet management, CMMS, and even stretching into mobile device
                management, SCADA, and security.
              </p>
              <p>
                As our entire IT department (including our director) was 5 FTE strong, I was able to play a secondary role and even lead some
                initiatives in departments outside of my specified pillar such as the M365 space, and primarily our Analytics department. Data 
                management and analysis were also at the core of my responsibilities as a result of this.
              </p> 
              <p>
                Coming from a strong programming background, at Heartland I was able to develop in T-SQL, C#, .NET 6-8, and JavaScript. While
                development was a large part of my day to day I had the pleasure of helping with our Azure tenant administration, SQL
                database administration, Azure DevOps administration, InTune administration, Sharepoint Administration, and so much more. It 
                was a pleasure to be able to enable data-driven decision-making and provide insights for stragic planning.

                    <h4>Description:</h4>
                    <p>
                      Our team at Heartland embarked on a mission to modernize our operational reporting processes. With a small but 
                      dedicated team, we developed an automated pipeline to gather and process data from various sources, including 
                      field sites and public databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our solution empowered field operators to make manual edits within a structured approval framework, eliminating 
                      redundant tasks and ensuring data accuracy. We also created a dynamic reporting portal using PowerBI, accessible 
                      to both field operators and headquarters staff, with enhanced security measures in place so the right information 
                      got to the right people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Through our efforts, we saved significant time and resources equivalent to one senior full-time employee, while 
                      enhancing data integrity and providing timely insights for decision-makers. Our project marks a significant step 
                      towards a more efficient, data-driven future for Heartland.

                          measures that were previously non-existent.

                    <p>
                      I spearheaded the design and implementation of a data extraction pipeline leveraging cutting-edge technologies to 
                      integrate our Management of Change (MOC) and incident tracking system within VelocityEHS into our in-house data 
                      warehouse. Utilizing web scraping techniques, ODATA connectors, and Azure Function Apps, we seamlessly integrated 
                      our operational data into the warehouse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This initiative not only streamlined our MOC and incident management processes but also resulted in significant cost 
                      savings. By eliminating the need for manual data requests and report improvements to the VelocityEHS developers, we 
                      saved over $5,000 in annual fees. Moreover, our solution enhanced operational efficiency and data accuracy by replacing 
                      many manual tasks, empowering our HSSE and operations teams to make informed decisions and drive continuous improvement 
                      initiatives.

                    <h4>Description:</h4>
                    <p>
                      At Heartland, our commitment to innovation led us to explore new technologies to enhance our web app development 
                      process. Transitioning from Vue.js to Blazor presented an opportunity to streamline development while aligning 
                      with our existing C# infrastructure, all while improving process for the front office finance team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In this project, I took the lead in designing and developing Heartland's first Blazor web app, with the invaluable 
                      support of a junior developer. Our primary objective was to reduce reliance on existing excel spreadsheets and 
                      modernize the experience by creating a finance web app (built in Blazor webassembly) that seamlessly integrated 
                      essential features such as SAML SSO with Azure Entra, PowerBI for reporting, live SQL database access, and in-app 
                      data entry with approval chains. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Within just 3-4 weeks, we delivered a working demo that greatly improved our finance reporting process. By automating 
                      tasks and reducing manual effort, our web app slashed reporting time by an average of 4 days per month. This 
                      transformation not only enhanced efficiency but also empowered our finance team with timely, accurate insights for 
                      decision-making.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While this project marked a significant milestone as Heartland's first Blazor web app, its true impact lies in its 
                      impact to the front office finance teams reporting processes, setting a new standard for our organizational teams.

                    <p>
                      At Heartland Generation, I led the design and implementation of an end-to-end solution for payroll automation, 
                      targeting Heartlands fleet of vehicles. This comprehensive solution included a locked Excel application for streamlined 
                      data entry, a SharePoint site for secure data hosting, and an Azure Logic App for seamless data ingestion and 
                      processing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      By automating the vehicle log book reporting process, our solution resulted in significant time savings for the 
                      field operations team, eliminating the need for copying data across multiple spreadsheets. Specifically, we achieved 
                      over one full week of time savings every month, allowing the team to focus on more strategic initiatives and enhancing 
                      operational efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This project exemplifies our commitment to innovation and efficiency, leveraging existing technology to streamline processes 
                      and drive tangible business outcomes. By implementing this payroll automation solution, we have not only saved 
                      valuable time and resources but also empowered our teams to work smarter and more effectively.

              <p>
                What ATB called Systems Analyst IV, others call a "DevOps Engineer". I was responsible for the development and
                maintanence of ATB Financials mobile app development pipeline. This included the development of CI/CD pipelines,
                server administration, database administration, and application administration. This role gave me exposure to the
                Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Salesforce administration, Octopus Deploy, and TeamCity. Aside from my administration 
                and development pipeline impact, I played a pivotal role in bridging communication between business representatives, 
                project managers, project analysts, solution architects, and my fellow "Wealth Solutions" development team members when
                it came to the implementation of new technologies within our environment.

                    <p>
                      The core objective of this endeavor was to revamp the end-to-end process of developing, testing, and deploying mobile 
                      applications; specifically the ATB Personal mobile app. Leveraging a combination of cutting-edge technologies and best 
                      practices, I orchestrated a comprehensive overhaul of the development pipeline. By harnessing Python, TeamCity, and 
                      Octopus Deploy, I, with the help and approval of our manager, engineered automated workflows that seamlessly integrated 
                      with our existing cloud infrastructure, ensuring rapid and reliable deployment of mobile applications across various platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, including mobile app developers, quality assurance specialists, and 
                      project managers, I meticulously analyzed existing workflows to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies for everyone. Through 
                      iterative refinement and optimization, I implemented CI/CD automation processes that accelerated the delivery of new features 
                      and updates while maintaining the highest standards of quality and reliability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This project yielded tangible results, including significant reductions in deployment times, improved code quality, and 
                      enhanced collaboration among team members. By driving innovation in mobile app development practices, I contributed to ATB 
                      Financial's ability to deliver cutting-edge solutions to customers, thereby positioning the organization for sustained 
                      growth and success in the digital landscape.

              <p>
                WBM Technologies, if you don't know, if a managed service provider.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the beginning I worked at Farm Credit Canada as Executve Support and was able to work closely with the C-Suite even getting
                to know their former CEO, Michael Hoffort, quite well. While I didn't stay in this position very long, I was able to make an impactful
                change by upgrading all 58 meeting rooms accross two towers to full "one-click" Teams rooms such that FCC became the first user of 
                Microsofts Gen 1 "Surface Hubs" in Canada.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, after moving to Alberta, I started contracting for Pembina Pipelines and quickly moved from leading their deployment of Windows 
                10 accross all field locations to being the sole Infrastructure Analyst for WBMs newly created managed service at Pembina.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a member of the Infrastructure Team I was responsible for the day to day operations of the service, including ticket management, 
                server administration (both on-prem and cloud based), documentation, change management, SCCM packaging, Azure tenant administration, 
                IAM, and more.

                    <p>
                      Pembina Pipelines engaged WBM Technologies to streamline their onboarding process, which was labor-intensive and prone to 
                      errors due to its manual nature. As an Infrastructure Analyst at WBM, I collaborated with a senior resource from Pembina's 
                      Infrastructure team to address this challenge. Our goal was to develop a PowerShell script capable of automating the 
                      provisioning of Active Directory (AD) and Azure Active Directory (AAD) components, as well as server permissions, within their 
                      hybrid environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Over the course of six months, we meticulously crafted a script that seamlessly integrated with Pembina's onboarding form 
                      in ServiceNow. Once a provisioning task was initiated, our script would swiftly execute, auto-provisioning the necessary 
                      resources based on the information provided. This automation significantly reduced the onboarding time, saving approximately 
                      three hours of work per onboard. By leveraging technology to automate these processes, we not only enhanced efficiency but 
                      also mitigated the risk of human error, ultimately improving the overall onboarding experience for Pembina Pipelines.

              <h4>Description:</h4>
              <p>
                As an Advanced Technologies Assistant at Sasktel, I was responsible for the day to day operations of the "experimental" server room. 
                This included ticket management, server administration, documentation, change management, and more. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This position allowed me to collaborate with a team of inspired individuals in Sasktel's IP division, delving into contemporary and
                legacy router technologies. I was even able to install and troubleshoot Cisco and Alcatel routers, contribute to major projects 
                involving server installations, craft custom bash scripts for automation, and independently tackle locally-hosted server maintanence, 
                broadening my technical proficiency and strengthening my networking knowledge.

                    <p>
                      As an Advanced Technologies Assistant at Sasktel, I spearheaded a project aimed at optimizing the layout and 
                      functionality of the "experimental" server room. Tasked by senior engineers, I meticulously crafted Visio diagrams to 
                      map out the server racks and T1 lines patch wall, enabling us to identify inefficiencies and strategically relocate 
                      equipment. In addition to creating comprehensive wiring diagrams, I physically reorganized servers to establish a more 
                      streamlined and organized environment. Throughout the process, I manually reconfigured networking settings on servers and  
                      switches to accommodate their new rack and switch connections, ensuring seamless operation of the infrastructure. 
                      Ultimately, this project enhanced the efficiency and functionality of Sasktel's experimental server room, facilitating 
                      smoother experimentation with custom routers and modems.

                As a Wireless Communications Technician at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) F Division, I played a key role in the repair

                I diagnosed and resolved issues, ensuring seamless communication across federal government agencies. Additionally, I reverse 
                engineered retired P25 Harris base stations (MASTR III's), developed custom PCBs for both towers and vehicles, and designed
                radio towers for optimal coverage in new locations.

                    <p>
                      During my tenure as a civilian wireless communications engineer at the RCMP's F Division, I spearheaded the "Cross-Border 
                      P25 Interoperability" project in collaboration with US Border Control. Drawing on my expertise in radio technology, 
                      particularly with Harris P25 systems, I facilitated the seamless integration of Canadian and US emergency communication 
                      systems. This involved designing a custom PCB to bridge the gap between disparate technologies and overseeing the creation 
                      of a new radio tower along the border to serve both nations. Despite navigating stringent regulatory frameworks on both sides 
                      of the border, the project proved immensely rewarding as it bolstered safety measures and fostered cross-border collaboration 
                      in emergency response efforts. My contributions to this project underscored the vital role of innovative engineering in 
                      enhancing public safety and security, leaving a lasting impact on border communication infrastructure.

                Saskatchewan Polytechnic allowed me to grow greatly in knowledge of the technological world and it's impact on individuals, as 
                well of the environment around us. I have taken courses here regarding almost every facet of computer engineering technology such as: 
                Wireless radio signals, diagnosis of micro-controllers, use of oscilloscope and function generators, computer programming, basic 
                mechanical engineering, intermediate electrical engineering, as well as many other topics.

                    <p>
                      For my final project at Saskatchewan Polytechnic, I decided to build a weather balloon that measured the Pfozer maximum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Typically speaking, this is something that space agencies will need to calculate when sending a rocket into space. The
                      Pfozer maximum is the maximum altitude that a rocket can reach before the ozone layer becomes too thin to protect the
                      rocket from the sun's radiation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For my attempt, I designed quite a bit, from the microcontroller firmware, to custom PCBs, to the camera gymbal and software, and
                      even to the balloon's hardware structure itself. Through some extensive testing I was able to integrate a geiger counter, altimeter,
                      and a few other sensors to the microcontroller, connect this to a cable that ran through the structures frame and acted as a 
                      long-range antenna, and transmit this information in real-time back to a custom built android app. Just to add some extra flair,
                      I also added a camera and a cutsom designed gymbal that would take a constant video for retrieval after the apparatus landed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While I had many struggles throughout my capstone project, ultimately I was able to create something I was truly proud of and ended
                      up getting a 99% on this project cementing my 4.0 GPA and admissions into the Deans Honor list for graduation.

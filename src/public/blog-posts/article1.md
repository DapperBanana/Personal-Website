Title: Random Thoughts

## About me

I know what you're thinking... This dude is amazing. It's true. 
My all truths and obviously no lies are: 
 1. Obama personally gave me a "coolest dude alive" award
 1. My IQ is about 3x that of Walter O'Brien
 1. I created Linux, Windows, and MacOS all in a drunken stupor in Berlin 1958

Pfft, what else to say really? If you want to know more about my personal life: 
 - When I'm not saving the city of Calgary at night in my cowboy-bat suit I work a day job as a mild-mannered developer.
 - This humble billionaire started off at the age of 3 creating semi-conductors out of his sandbox with his bare hands. That's right folks, he's a certified _computer engineer_; He's got letters and everything at the end of his name.
 - I've won so many Game Jams that we've had to remove my name from the winners list so as to not make other devs feels inferior

That's not really what you want to know though is it. All you care about is the projects, the good stuff. You want to know what programs this daring young time-traveling lad has created that have saved the world countless times from the mighty Eugene "The Plague" Belford. (Yeah that's right, I saw Hackers, I have three monitors)
